Alice: "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"

The Cheshire Cat: "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to."

Alice: "I don't much care where—"

The Cheshire Cat: "Then it doesn't matter which way you go."

Alice: "...so long as I get somewhere."

The Cheshire Cat: "Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough."
