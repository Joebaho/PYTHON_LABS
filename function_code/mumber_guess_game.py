PYTHON LAB: number_guess-game.py.py

Write a Python program that will :
Guess the correct number enter by a user in 5 guesses. If you donâ€™t get it right after 5 guesses you lose the game.
Give user input box: 1. To capture guesses, he /she will choose number between 1 to 50.
print message to tell user if guess is too high/low ,and let them know the rest of guesses remaining.
print(and input boxes)  If user wins  or If user loses
